/**
 * IDEAS:
 *  - make the text box read-only while the simulation is playing
 *  - add break points
 *  - have the text box highlight the line that is currently being executed
 *
 * TODO: see if there is more sophisticated gutter mechanisms to
 * present comments and errors to the user
 * http://codemirror.net/doc/upgrade_v3.html#gutters
 *
 * TODO: listen for changes in the document and automatically update gutter
 * with comments and errors
 *
 * TODO: how to keep width of gutter constant?
 *
 * IDEA: breakpoints, see http://codemirror.net/demo/marker.html
 *
 * TODO: error text usually needs to be more verbose. Perhaps add a link to
 * a popup that explains the error and gives references.
 *
 * IDEA: put drop-down boxes in comment section so you can fit more text there
